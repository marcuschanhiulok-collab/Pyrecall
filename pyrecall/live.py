    1. Each call to :meth:`record` appends an interaction to a local SQLite DB.
    2. Once *batch_size* untrained interactions accumulate, a JSONL file is
       exported and :py:meth:`Model.learn` is called for one epoch.
    3. Trained rows are marked so they are never included in a future batch.
